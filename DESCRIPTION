Description: The package implements a robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for the statistical model described in [1]. The model incorporates data calibration ("normalization"), an intensity-dependent error model ("variance-versus-mean-dependence") and a data transformation that leads to a measure of differential expression which is independent of the mean intensity, and is usually more sensitive/specific than the "log-ratio". [1] Variance stabilization applied to microarray data calibration and to the quantification of differential expression, Wolfgang Huber, Anja von Heydebreck, Holger S\"ultmann, Annemarie Poustka, Martin Vingron; Bioinformatics (2002) 18 Suppl1 S96-S104.
